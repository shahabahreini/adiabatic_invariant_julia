# adiabatic_invariant_julia üß≤

This project offers a numerical simulation of charged particle dynamics in EM (Electromagnetic) fields. It strives to model the magnetic nozzle structure and helps develop a stable, low-error method to preserve total energy and investigate the adiabatic invariant. This is part of an M.Sc. Thesis at the University of Saskatchewan - Particle in EM Fields, in the Department of Computer Science.

## Installation Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these instructions to get your system up and running:

### 1. Install Julia üöÄ
Visit the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the provided instructions to install Julia.

### 2. Install Python and Pip üêç
- **Python:** Use the [Python official instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python on your OS.
- **Pip:** To install Pip (needed for package installation), follow the [instructions here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### 3. Install Julia and Python Packages üì¶

In the root folder, run the following commands:

\`\`\`
julia install_packages.jl
python3 pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

## Running Simulation üöÄ

### Updating Initial Conditions
Edit "initial_conditions.txt" to update the simulation's initial conditions.

### Updating Simulation Equations
Modify the functions "CylindricalProblem!" in "Simulation2D.jl" or "Simulation3D.jl" to change the dynamics of the simulations.

### Numerical Simulation üßÆ
Run the Julia core using one of the following methods:

a) **Single-Core Mode:** Use this command for single-core processing, then follow the on-screen instructions:

\`\`\`
julia Start.jl
\`\`\`

b) **Multi-Core Mode:** For multi-core processing, add '-t [number of cores]' before calling the Julia script. Here's an example using 4 cores:

\`\`\`
julia -t 4 Start.jl
\`\`\`
